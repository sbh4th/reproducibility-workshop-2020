Enterprising grad students found:
- impossible values
- incorrect ANOVA results
- dubious p-values

# Plan for today
## 1. Scientific Integrity Problems (1220h-1250h) `r emo::ji("coffee")`

## 2. Design Solutions (1300h-1330h)

## 3. Analytic Solutions (1330h-1350h, `r emo::ji("coffee")` 1400h-1450h `r emo::ji("coffee")`)

## 4. Dissemination Solutions (1500h-1530)

## 5. Reproducible Example (1530h-1600h)
