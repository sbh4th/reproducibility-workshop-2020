# Replication files provide the 'recipe' for reproducing your results.

Should: 
- be complete but parsimonious. Don't over do it.
- run / reproduce results with minimal effort (1-click).
- be "literate" (human readable).
- protect confidential data.

There is no single, perfect way to organize or prepare files for replication.

Find a workflow that works well for you.

# Step 1: Generate replication files
.footnote[ Clark (2017)]

.left-column[
```{r, echo=F}
ggplot() + geom_fontawesome("fa-clone", color='steelblue') + theme_void()
```
]

.right-column[
1. Create a new organized empty replication folder within your project directory (e.g., “replication_files/”)

2. Subfolders: Should be same as overall file structure:
 - .blue[code/] — scripts
  - .blue[data_clean/] — manipulated data
  - .blue[data_raw/] — original data
  - .blue[output/] — generated tables, graphs, etc.
  - .blue[extra/] — misc. extras (e.g., code book)

3. A "README" text/markdown file to document contents, sources, software/system versions, other info necessary for replication/comprehension.
]

# Step 2: Replicate your own results
.footnote[ Clark (2017)]

.left-column[
```{r, echo=F}
ggplot() + geom_fontawesome("fa-copy", color='steelblue') + theme_void()
```
]

.right-column[
1. Copy data and code to your new replication directory.

2. After copying all of the relevant files, see if you can replicate the results in your paper.

3. May want to start with the "final" products (i.e., tables and figures from clean data), which should be "easiest" to replicate.

4. Check for errors and make sure all is well.

5. Now copy the original raw data and cleaning scripts and run the entire thing.

6. All good? If not, debug and try again.
]

# Step 3: Final check
.footnote[ Clark (2017)]
.left-column[
```{r, echo=F}
ggplot() + geom_fontawesome("fa-check", color='steelblue') + theme_void()
```
]

.right-column[
1. Shut down and restart software package.

2. Replicate again...all good?

3. Or have a friend / colleague try on another computer.

4. Fix any remaining bugs and try again.

5. Now ready to disseminate!

### How replication can help

```{r, echo=F}

```
]

.right-column[
### Facilitate reproducibility
#### Anyone can reproduce your tables and figures.

### Detects errors
#### Coding is hard. We all make mistakes.

### Extends work
#### Probes reliability of findings, answers new questions.

## Rationale for sharing data and code
.pull-left[
Online repositories last longer, are indexed.

Concerns:

- Can usually be embargoed, or provide only what is necessary for replication (e.g., unused survey Qs).

- Biggest risk isn't having your data/ideas stolen, it's having your research ignored! (King 1995)

- *More* difficult if research products are proprietary.

## Same code, different environment
.footnote[More advanced than we can cover today. See https://mybinder.org and https://hub.docker.com/ for more. ]

Code may not run somewhere else. People are working on that:
.right-column[
### Docker containers
#### packages up everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings in a standalone, executable package.

### Binder
#### a service that provides your code and the hardware and software to execute it (mostly R, Python).

# When to share data or code?

## Many options

### 1. Include everything with submitted paper (public)
### 2. Include everything with submitted paper (for review)
### 3. Post-publication (recall TOP guidelines)

### Biased anecdote for benefits of sharing *with* paper submission
.pull-left[
"Thanks for the opportunity to review this interesting paper. It is exciting to see the FARS data used in this way. **It was also exciting that you shared your code and this allowed me to review your work in a way I have not done before.**"
.right[-Reviewer 1]
]

.pull-right[
"Overall verdict: This paper was both exciting and a pleasure to read. Clearly written, well argued, and with a highly commendable open science approach. As a referee, one frequently thinks 'why didn’t they report the results of a model with...' - and in this case **I was able to download the data, assess their code scripts, and run my own specification to see how it changed things**."

### Open Science Foundation
.pull-left[
OSF (http://osf.io) provides a central location to manage project files.

Any type of files can be uploaded (up to 5GB).

Most common file types will render to be viewed on OSF.

OSF also provides a more comprehensive system for planning, documenting, executing, and disseminating your research over the entire life cycle of a project--and beyond.

### 1. Create a structured workspace.
### 2. (Possibly) pre-register study 
### 3. Deposit / add study materials.
### 4. Add and document analyses.
### 5. Share study data, materials, and code.

## Synthetic data may also be possible

- mimics an original dataset, preserving its statistical properties and relationships between variables

- classification and regression tree approach

- 0% disclosure risk

- `synthpop` R package `r emo::ji("package")`

2. Need to regenerate the model and table results.

- Is it 6 months later?
- Could someone else take over and figure out what you did?

Selfish reasons to work reproducibly:
- Helps to avoid disaster.
- Makes it easier to write papers.
- Can help reviewers
- Enables continuity of your work.
- Builds your scholarly reputation.
