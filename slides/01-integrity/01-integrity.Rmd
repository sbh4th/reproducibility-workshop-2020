### Core Values of Scientific Research
1. Universalism

.footnote[ Merton (1942), Christensen et al. (2019)]

.pull-left[
### Norms
- *Universalism*: Evaluate research only on its merit.

- *Communality*: Openly share new findings.

- *Disinterestedness*: Motivated by the desire for knowledge and discovery.

- *Skepticism*: Consider all new evidence, hypotheses, theories, and innovations, even those that challenge or contradict their own work.
]

.pull-right[
### Counternorms
- *Particularism*: New knowledge from reputation or group.

- *Secrecy*: Protect own findings for private gain.

- *Self-interestedness*: Colleagues are competitors.

- *Dogmatism*: Protecting one's own findings, resisting alternatives.

### Researcher "degrees of freedom" are difficult to control
.footnote[ Source: Gary King]

.pull-left[
### How are analyses conducted?
- collect the data over many months.
- finish recording and merging.
- run *one* regression.
- new regression, different controls.
- now a different functional form.
- new regression, different measures.
- yet another regression on subset.
- have 100 or 1000 estimates.
- 1 or maybe 5 results in the paper.
]

.pull-right[
### What's the problem?
- Some result is designated as the “correct” one, only *after* looking
at the estimates.

- Is this a true test of a hypothesis or just confirmation bias?

- This is "p-hacking"
