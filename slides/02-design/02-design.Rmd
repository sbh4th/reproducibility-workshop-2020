### Time stamped
#### Records and publicizes time and date


### Read-only

Common / required for publishing most RCTs

Controversial for observational studies.

Idea is to help *reduce publication bias*, since registered studies may be followed over time.

No guarantee anyone will publish.

Also can provide intellectual provenance of your ideas and hypotheses.

Good for planning and hypothesizing, .red[not a straightjacket.]

# Why preregistration?
1. It's *not* about minimizing Type 1 errors.
- Allowing others to transparently evaluate the credibility of the analysis
- Preventing "file drawer" problems.

---
# Why not preregistration?
- Observational studies are hard.
- Manuscripts may adhere to registrations rather than reality.
- Prespecification is irrelevant to the credibility of inference.
- Severe tests of hypotheses are more important than prespecification.

In 2000 NHLBI required the registration of primary outcome on ClinicalTrials.gov for all their grant-funded activity.

Increase in "null" findings.

# Writing up pre-registered studies

## 1. Include a link to the registration 
## 2. Report *all* pre-registered results.
## 3. Explain and justify deviations.
## 4. Non-registered analyses named "exploratory", etc.

.right-column[
- Detailed description of research design and data analysis plans, submitted to a registry before looking at the data.

- Helps to tie your hands for data analysis (address researcher degrees of freedom, etc.)

- Distinguish between confirmatory and exploratory analysis

- Increases the credibility of research

- Transparent methods make it easier for others to build on your work

## What goes into a pre-analysis plan?

.pull-left[
- General info (Title, PIs, Staff)

- Introduction and Summary

- Study Design:
  - Hypotheses
  - Main variables
  - Study setting.
  - Intervention components.
  - Data collection methods.
  - Treatment assignment mechanism.
  - Power calculations.

.pull-right[
- Analytical decisions
  - models
  - derived variables
  - clustering
  - multiple testing
  
- Threats/mitigation/robustness checks.
