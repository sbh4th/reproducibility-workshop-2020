Common / required for publishing most RCTs

Controversial for observational studies.

Idea is to help *reduce publication bias*, since registered studies may be followed over time.

No guarantee anyone will publish.

Also can provide intellectual provenance of your ideas and hypotheses.

Good for planning and hypothesizing, .red[not a straightjacket.]

## Why not preregistration?
- Observational studies are hard.

- Manuscripts may adhere to registrations rather than reality.

- May discourage innovation/exploration.

- Pre-specification is irrelevant to the credibility of inference.

- Severe tests of hypotheses are more important than pre-specification.
