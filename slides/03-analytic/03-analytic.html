# Why Projects?
By definition, the directory `/User/samharper/project/data` is not reproducible.  
But `project/data` works anywhere.

### Self contained and portable
### Easy to integrate with version control
### Working directory set at project location when opened
### Fresh session when project is launched

---
## File organization
.left-column[
![](tree-directory.png)
]

.right-column[
### Core idea is to separate raw data, analytic data, code, and outputs.

### Why?
- Raw data is **never** altered.
- Separating code from data streamlines re-analysis.
- Outputs (tables, figures) are transient and should be easily regenerated from data + scripts.

# Your turn (finally!): Create a project
- Use RStudio or Stata (or something else) to create a new project
- Call it 'myproject'
- Create folders for `data`, `code`, and `output`.

- Now close the program.
- Browse to where the program file exists and double-click.
- Where is the current directory located? (Hint: type `getwd()` into the R console or `pwd` in the Stata command line).

### What should be documented?
- Data sources

- Data decisions
- Statistical analysis

- Software

- Storage
]

### Levels of documentation
- Research log

# Research Log
.left-column[
&lt;img src="03-analytic_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="100%" height="100%" /&gt;
]

.right-column[
The research log should help with:
- Keeping the work on track. Ideas, decision about analysis, papers you read that are relevant...document your thinking!
 
- Dealing with interruptions.
 
- Facilitating replication by others (especially by you 6 months later).
 
Ideally this should document what you did, why you did it, and how you did it.

## Codebooks
.pull-left[
Codebook is crucial, especially if you are collecting your own data.

Should include:
- Variable name and question number.
- Survey questions.
- Skip patterns.
- Descriptive statistics.
- Missing values and reasons.
- Data imputation.

### More general coding advice
Comment extensively!

Short lines with no wrapping

Give functions, objects, and variables intuitive names:  
- `edu_percent` 👍
- `v76` 👎

Label variables and values (remember codebook advice).

Avoid abbreviations for commands (Stata).

Consider breaking long files into several shorter ones.

### Essential parts of a syntax file

This example is for Stata, but the same principles apply to any software.

## Alignment, indentation, automation are your friends...

.pull-left[
### Harder to read
```s
keep sid class_id teacher grade1 ///
grade2 grade3 pass
```
### Without automation
```s
//  create binary variables without loop
generate y_lt2 = y&lt;2 if !missing(y)
generate y_lt3 = y&lt;3 if !missing(y)
generate y_lt4 = y&lt;4 if !missing(y)
```
]

.pull-right[
### Easier to read
```s
keep   sid class_id teacher grade1 ///
       grade2 grade3 pass
```
### With automation
```s
//  create binary variables using a loop
foreach cutpt in 2 3 4 {
    gen y_lt`cutpt' = y&lt;`cutpt' if !missing(y)
  }
```
]

## Save outputs as objects to insert into papers
.pull-left[
R:

```r
# a boring regression
lm(dist ~ 1 + speed, data = cars)

# save regression results for later
*fit &lt;- lm(dist ~ 1 + speed, data = cars)
```
Note that `fit` contains our coefficients and SEs. Now write to a table:

```r
library(broom) # need broom pkg
write.csv( tidy( fit ), "t1.csv")
```
Now `t1.csv` has estimates.
]

.pull-right[
Stata:

```stata
webuse auto, clear

// another boring regression 
regress price mpg
*estimates store m1
```
Here `m1` contains our model results. Write to a table:

```stata
// need eststo package
esttab m1 using t1.csv
```
Now `t1.csv` has estimates.
]

---
### Can be adapted to other software
.left-column[
Key idea:  
- Results are *static* tables.

- Inserted into compiled manuscript.

- No copy/paste.
]

.right-column[
Example using SAS's **O**utput **D**elivery **S**ystem (ODS):
```sas
data etoh;
set analysis.analysis;

ods select ParameterEstimates;
*ods csv file = "/home/sam.harper/Output/model.csv";
proc logistic data=etoh;
model drunk = free;
run;
ods csv close;

# Structure and name files intuitively.

.left-column[
&lt;img src="03-analytic_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="100%" height="100%" /&gt;
]

.right-column[
Give code, data files, and output logical names where possible.

Number scripts sequentially in the order they should be run, e.g.,: 
- .blue[01_clean_data.R] (or .blue[.do, .sas, etc.])
- .blue[02_main_analysis.R]
- .blue[03_robust_checks.R]

Label output figures with descriptive names, but ones that aren’t likely to change (e.g., .blue[figure_hte.png] is better than .blue[figure_1.png])
]

# "One script to rule them all"

.left-column[
![](frodo-ring.jpg)
]

.right-column[
### Many papers require multiple scripts.
### Dependencies create problems.
### Create a .blue[master-script] to run everything.
### Facilitates '1-click' reproduction.
]

---
### Example of a "master" script (Stata)
This is the content of `code/mvc-laws-master.do`:

```stata
capture log close master
log using "code/mvc-laws-master", name(master) replace text

//  program:  mvc-laws-master.do
//  task:     run all analyses
//  project:  mandatory seat belt laws and traffic deaths
//  author:   sam harper \ 23feb2017

// Required user-written programs: -tabout, -metan, -estout, -egenmore
// Can be downloaded by typing "ssc install tabout, replace"  and
// "ssc install metan, replace", etc. into the Stata command line


do "code/mvc-laws-data.do"                   // create analytic dataset
do "code/mvc-laws-analysis-descriptives.do"  // descriptive table
do "code/mvc-laws-analysis-models.do"        // model results
do "code/mvc-laws-analysis-appendix.do"      // appendix tables/figures

log close master
exit
```

---
### Your turn #2: Let's create a master script.

1) Open the `myproject` you created in R or Stata and create a new script (File&gt;New File&gt; R Script or File&gt; New &gt; Do-file. Type the following code:
- R: `print("Hello world!")`
- Stata: `disp "Hello world!"`

2) Save it as `1-hello.R` or `1-hello.do` in the "code" folder. 

3) Repeat, creating another new script for `2-goodbye.R`, but type `"Goodbye world!"` instead of `"Hello world!"`
    
Now create a master script called `0-master.R`  or `0-master.do` that will run the two other scripts you created. The command to execute another file is `source` in R and is `do` in Stata. 

4) Run the .blue[master] script. 

- Success?

---
## How can version control help?
.left-column[
![](03-analytic_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

.right-column[
With version control you can:

- Collaborate
- Track each change and **who** made it
- Easily switch between versions of files (i.e. go backward in time)
- Compare versions of files
- Backup
- Work with the same files on different machines
- Collaborators can work simultaneously on the same files on different machines
- Experiment with a new version of code without permanently ruining anything
]

---
## Manual solutions (works, but not ideal)

.left-column[

]

.right-column[
Create dated versions of files (save-as) for each substantive change
 
With each modification, re-run ALL code to make sure nothing is broken—helps if you have a master file to run all scripts!
 
Check-in with coauthors to ensure multiple people aren't working on the same files at the same time.
 
Keep a simple log to remind yourself of the location/content of major changes.
]

---
## Software solutions

.right-column[
Version control software: helps manage versions and edits to files.

Git: Open-source, “distributed model” of version control developed by creator of Linux.

GitHub / GitLab: Free, web-based service that hosts Git “repositories” and offers a variety of features for collaboration:
- Online
- Desktop apps
- Command line (more technical)

How does Git work?
![](github-workflow-diagram.png)


---
# Advantages of Git

### Provides the entire narrative of your project.
### Allows you to go back in time.
### Experiment without breaking things.
![](git-hello-example.png)

---
### How is that better than Dropbox?
.left-column[
Simultaneous editing in Dropbox leads to "conflicted" copies of files.

Only one person can edit the "live" version of the file.

Can "rollback" to earlier version, but that affects everyone.

# What are dynamic documents?
Even with perfect (version controlled) code, you can still run into problems going from your code to paper.  (copy → paste problems)

--

### This is where dynamic documents come in.

A dynamic document includes your data, code, analysis, and output all in one place.

Fully automated so no mistakes from copying and pasting.

Several formats, but most commonly using R Markdown in RStudio or Markdoc in Stata.

---
.footnote[Krieger *PLoS* (2019)]
.center[
![:scale 90%](krieger-workflow.png)
]

---
## How can dynamic documents help?

- Include tables by linking to a file, instead of a static image.
- Reference an estimate (e.g. risk ratio) by linking to a value calculated by an analysis file, instead of a static number typed manually.
- Automatically update tables and numbers if models and/ or data changes.
- Produce entire paper with one or two clicks.
- Most written using markdown language.

```r{eval=FALSE}
fit1 &lt;- lm(y ~ x, data=d)
``````
Inline code: single backtick  `` `r
1+1` ``.

Structure for Stata Markdown:
```yaml
---
header:
---
```
Same idea for code 'chunks':

```yaml
```s
// Write stata code inside chunks
sum mpg
``````
Inline: single backtick `` `s
r(mean)` ``.

### Allow text to update automatically when results change.
.pull-left[
Rmarkdown:

Header + document text followed by code chunk:

```yaml
```r{eval=FALSE}
fit1 &lt;- lm(y ~ x, data=d)
est &lt;- summary(fit1)$coefficients["x","Estimate"]
``````
We find x increases y by  `` `r
est` ``.

.blue[Will update if data or estimates change.]

.pull-right[
Structure for Stata Markdown:

Header + text with Stata code chunks:

```yaml
```s
reg price mpg
``````
Mpg increases price by `` `s
_b[mpg]` `` with a standard error of `` `s
_se[mpg]` ``.

.blue[These are dynamic values.]

### Stata markdown example (start at project directory)
.pull-left[
Stata do-file (`code/paper.do`) calls the markdown file using the `markstat` command:
```s
// change to writing directory
cd writing


// generate the manuscript
markstat using "paper.stmd", pdf

// back to the main directory
cd ..
```

### Rmarkdown + results from SAS

1. Use SAS to fit models, generate results.

2. Export results to files.

3. 'Knit' together with text using Rmarkdown.
