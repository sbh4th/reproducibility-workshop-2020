The research log should help with:
- Keeping the work on track. Ideas, decision about analysis, papers you read that are relevant...document your thinking!
 
- Dealing with interruptions.
 
- Facilitating replication by others (especially by you 6 months later).
 
Ideally this should document what you did, why you did it, and how you did it.

### More general coding advice
Comment extensively!

Short lines with no wrapping

Give functions, objects, and variables intuitive names like edu_percent rather than v76

Label variables and values in Stata

Avoid abbreviations for commands (Stata)

Alignment and indentation:

keep   sid class_id teacher grade1 ///
       grade2 grade3 pass
keep sid class_id teacher grade1 ///
grade2 grade3 pass

# Structure and name files intuitively.

Give code, data files, and output logical names where possible.

Number scripts sequentially in the order they should be run, e.g.,: 
- .blue[01_clean_data.R]
- .blue[02_main_analysis.R]
- .blue[03_robust_checks.R]

Label output figures with descriptive names, but ones that aren’t likely to change (e.g., .blue[figure_hte.png] is better than .blue[figure_1.png])

### Many papers require multiple scripts.
### Dependencies create problems.
### Create a .blue[master-script] to run everything.
### Facilitates '1-click' reproduction.
]

### Example of a "master" script (Stata)
```{stata, eval=F}
capture log close master
log using "code/mvc-laws-master", name(master) replace text

//  program:  mvc-laws-master.do
//  task:     run all analyses
//  project:  mandatory seat belt laws and traffic deaths
//  author:   sam harper \ 23feb2017

// Required user-written programs: -tabout, -metan, -estout, -egenmore
// Can be downloaded by typing "ssc install tabout, replace"  and
// "ssc install metan, replace", etc. into the Stata command line


do "code/mvc-laws-data.do"                   // create analytic dataset
do "code/mvc-laws-analysis-descriptives.do"  // descriptive table
do "code/mvc-laws-analysis-models.do"        // model results
do "code/mvc-laws-analysis-appendix.do"      // appendix tables/figures

log close master
exit
```

---
### Writing "robust" code/scripts
- Comment extensively
- Use self-contained syntax  
- Version control
- Exclude directory information - use relative paths:
 

NO: 
```{r, eval=F}
use '/Users/samharper/Dropbox/-today/replication/workshop/project/data-clean.dta'
```
 
YES:
```{r, eval=F}
use 'data-clean.dta'
```
 
- Include seeds for random numbers
- Archive user written programs / .ado files
- Automate as much as you can to avoid mistakes and repetition.

]

## A version control system (VCS) automatically keeps track of changes to files and code.
.center[
```{r, echo=F, out.width=600, out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics("vc-image.png")
```
]

---
## How can version control help?

.pull-left[
Under VCS the prior collaboration would only have 4 files:
- cleans data → .blue[data]

- analysis → .blue[analysis]

- generates results → .blue[results]

- generates manuscript → .blue[manuscript]
]

--

.pull-right[
Notice the lack of file extensions.

This is because all files are based on source code

We just don't usually see it.
]

---
## How can version control help?
With version control you can:

- Collaborate
- Track each change and **who** made it
- Easily switch between versions of files (i.e. go backward in time)
- Compare versions of files
- Backup
- Work with the same files on different machines
- Collaborators can work simultaneously on the same files on different machines
- Experiment with a new version of code without permanently ruining anything

---
## Manual solutions (works, but not ideal)

.left-column[

]

.right-column[
Create dated versions of files (save-as) for each substantive change
 
With each modification, re-run ALL code to make sure nothing is broken—helps if you have a master file to run all scripts!
 
Check-in with coauthors to ensure multiple people aren't working on the same files at the same time.
 
Keep a simple log to remind yourself of the location/content of major changes.
]

---
## Software solutions

.right-column[
Version control software: helps manage versions and edits to files (e.g., Microsoft Word’s “track changes”, or Google Doc’s “suggestion” feature)—many options.

Git: Open-source, “distributed model” of version control developed by creator of Linux.

GitHub / GitLab: Free, web-based service that hosts Git “repositories” and offers a variety of features for collaboration:
- Online
- Desktop apps
- Command line (more technical)

# Advantages of Git

## Provides the entire narrative of your project.

## Allows you to go back in time.

How does Git work?
![](github-workflow-diagram.png)

---
### How is that better than Dropbox?
.left-column[
Simultaneous editing in Dropbox leads to "conflicted" copies of files.

Only one person can edit the "live" version of the file.

Can "rollback" to earlier version, but that affects everyone.

# What are dynamic documents?
Even with perfect (version controlled) code, you can still run into problems going from your code to paper.  (copy → paste problems)

--

### This is where dynamic documents come in.

A dynamic document includes your data, code, analysis, and output all in one place.

Fully automated so no mistakes from copying and pasting.

Several formats, but most commonly using R Markdown in RStudio or Markdoc in Stata.

---
## How can dynamic documents help?

Include tables by linking to a file, instead of a static image.

Reference an estimate (e.g. risk ratio) by linking to a value calculated by an analysis file, instead of a static number typed manually.

Automatically update tables and numbers if models and/ or data changes.

Produce entire paper with one or two clicks.

---
### Example of a whole paper written and submitted with Rmarkdown 
.pull-left[

## Save outputs as objects to insert into papers
.pull-left[
R:
```{r comment='#', eval=F}
# a boring regression
lm(dist ~ 1 + speed, data = cars)

# save regression results for later
{{fit <- lm(dist ~ 1 + speed, data = cars)}}
```
Note that `fit` contains our results.]

.pull-right[
Stata:
```{stata, eval=F}
webuse auto, clear

// another boring regression 
regress price mpg
{{estimates store m1}}
```
Here `m1` contains our model results.
]

---
### Can be adapted to other software
.left-column[
Key idea:  
- Results are *static* tables.

- Inserted into compiled manuscript.

- No copy/paste.
